			<p id="intro"> California Club Tennis is a student-run organization that practices and competes throughout the school year. The club is a part of UC Berkeley's Rec Sports Clubs, playing in USTA Tennis On Campus Tournaments. We use World Team Tennis rules in match play, which emphasizes both singles and doubles play. During the fall, we compete against Northern California teams at schools such as Stanford, UC Davis and Sac State. In the spring the team travels to invitational tournaments playing against the best teams across the nation.</p>

We have been on the team since our freshman year and consider the team to be our closest bond with the university. We can't wait to meet all of the great players trying out this fall and we're excited for the year we have ahead of us! GO BEARS!

			<h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li id="firstq">When and where are tryouts?</li>
					<p>Our annual tryout tournament is usually held on a weekend in early September. Make sure to stop by our booth at Caltopia and check our calendar for updates!</p>
				<li>How many people are allowed on the team?</li>
					<p>There is no minimum or maximum number, and it varies from year to year. We take individuals based off of their overall fit with the team as well as talent level, so there are no limitations.</p>
				<li>How much time will I have to commit to the team?</li>
					<p>Club Tennis is all about putting in as much as you want to get out of it! Many activities are voluntary and flexible. We understand that your first priority is school, and our captains are lenient to scheduling conflicts. We have set practices twice (and sometimes three times) a week on Tuesday and Thursday nights from 7-9pm. However, it is important to note that our captains are constantly evaluating the contributions each individual makes to the team. Also, regional and national tournaments require participants to have played a minimum amount of previous tournaments to qualify, so please keep that in mind.</p>
				<li>Oh no! I didn't make the team! What now?</li>
					<p>Don't worry! There will always be the next year to try out. Each year we have a huge number of crazy talented people come out, which means our decision is always extremely tough.</p>

					<p>In the meantime, you should definitely consider joining Cal's intramural tennis club, Tennis at Cal. It's a great group of people for all levels of tennis who just love to play. In fact, there are several people on the Cal Club Tennis team who are also on Tennis at Cal. </p>
