        <h3 class="question">Q: When and where are tryouts?</h3>
        <p class="info">A: Our annual tryout tournament is usually held on a weekend in early September. Make sure to stop by our booth at Caltopia and check back here for updates!</p>
        <h3 class="question">Q: How many people are allowed on the team?</h3>
        <p class="info">A: There is no minimum or maximum number, and it varies from year to year. We take individuals based off of their overall fit with the team as well as talent level, so there are no limitations.</p>
        <h3 class="question">Q: How much time do I have to commit to the team?</h3>
        <p class="info">A: Club Tennis is all about putting in as much as you want to get out of it! Many activities are voluntary and flexible. We understand that your first priority is school, and our captains are lenient to scheduling conflicts. We have set practices twice (and sometimes three times) a week on Tuesday and Thursday nights from 7-9pm. However, it is important to note that our captains are constantly evaluating the contributions each individual makes to the team. Also, regional and national tournaments require participants to have played a minimum amount of previous tournaments to qualify, so please keep that in mind.</p>
        <h3 class="question">Q: Oh no! I didn't make the team! What now?</h3>
        <p class="info">A: Don't worry, there's always be the next year! Each year we have a huge number of crazy talented people come out, which means our decision is always extremely tough. In the meantime, you should definitely consider joining Cal's intramural tennis club, Tennis at Cal. It's a great group of people for all levels of tennis who just love to play. In fact, there are several people on the Cal Club Tennis team who are also on Tennis at Cal.</p>
